*Tired of losing books with valuable information when off exploring? Of leaving signs to pass notes to your friends, accomplices, and minions when they aren't online? Of seeing walls of signs used for server rules? Welcome, then, a new communication tool ...*

EnderBooks
==========

Ender books are roughly to books what ender chests are to chests — books that share their contents across all instances of that particular book.  This allows for communication independent of both time and space, as an ender book can only be edited by its author, but read by any player.

**Possible uses:**

* permanent storage for useful information
* communication between players on a server
* a mechanism to distribute server rules or admin notices

**Additional requirements:**

The mod can be acquired [here](http://adf.ly/Mv2Kf) (alternate download link, if you can't download from MEGA: [here](http://adf.ly/MvJWg)), and requires Minecraft Forge build 7.7.0.600 or newer (available from [here](http://files.minecraftforge.net/)).

Possible future features
----------

Possible things that will be added in the future:

* allowing books to be renamed after creation
* books created with the same name by the same player show the same content
* garbage collection of old, unused books (may conflict with the previous item)

This mod is based off the idea proposed by TheRegularHexahedron (with suggestions by mrout) on the [MinecraftSuggestions](http://www.reddit.com/r/minecraftsuggestions) subreddit, found [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/minecraftsuggestions/comments/1bdmn0/ender_books/).  All coding and images were done by myself, sephthir.

Crafting
----------

An ender book is crafted by combining a book-and-quill with an eye of ender:

When an ender book is crafted, it is not associated with a particular player until it is opened the first time, at which point it represents a new book owned by that player.  Obviously then, there needs to be a way to duplicate an existing ender book so they represent the same book.

An existing ender book can be duplicated much akin to how maps are copied — one can craft a new ender book with a written ender book in the table (meaning: book-and-quill, eye of ender, and a written ender book), or with an unwritten ender book together with a written one:

Screenshots

Unwritten ender books, ender books written by you, and ender books written by other players all look different in the inventory, making it easy to tell them apart at a glance (that way you always know which ones are yours).

The GUI is similar to that of a book, except that you specify a title immediately upon opening an unwritten ender book for the first time.  Titles are permanent after the first open, so choose wisely!

The actual content-editing GUI is identical to that of a book, and functions the same way.  By default, ender books only have 25 pages, rather than 50, to try to keep them more balanced.  However, this is a configurable value in the mod's configuration file, so it can be changed on a per-world basis.

Books that you own always show up with the quill, in inventories, your hands, and other players' hands.  (And look pretty cool, too!)
